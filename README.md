## What you need to know about NodeJS : Dive into the fundementals of NodeJS

## Written By Bruno Joseph Dmello


### Why am I doing this?

Honestly, out of curiousity and I want to know more about NodeJS and well what better way to learn more about something than to read/test the sample examples. I figure this way I'd get a better understanding and learn more on NodeJS.

I hope whoever stumbles upon it, gets the book and try it out for yourself.

Why not? - What's the worst that could happen?
